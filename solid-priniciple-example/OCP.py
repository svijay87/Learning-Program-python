"""
RBI now has a virtual method working_hours. We have each banks extend the RBI class and implement the virtual working_hours method.
Every class adds its own implementation on how it suites to client friendly and employee friendly working hours. 
The working_hours iterates through the array of banks and just calls its working_hours method.
Now, if we add a new Banks, banks_working_hours doesnâ€™t need to change. 
All we need to do is add the new Bank to the banks array.
banks_working_hours now conforms to the OCP principle.
